                        Upwork has a sliding scale, meaning the more you work, the less money you pay. For example, the commission fee starts from 20% for the first bill of $500 and gradually reduces as you receive more money.

                       <p>RapidWorkers is a micro-jobs website that provides small and simple-to-do tasks either from home or wherever you have access to a computer or mobile device with an internet connection.
                        Let me say something about rapid workers. The maximum international job they pay its around $0.10 it may seem small to some of you guys but in making money online any amount counts.
So if you make a daily target of $1 a day thats around 10-15 tasks a day
In a month you will make $30 then you will suppliment with other methods.

                           As your audience expands, you'll be able to sell them items and services (such as coaching or consulting), but you'll also be able to support yourself by endorsing other people's goods in exchange for a sponsorship or commission.</span>

                    <h3>Resume Writer</h3>
                    <span>Although it may appear easy to write a resume, most people frequently struggle to sell themselves.
                        Offer your services to others if you've been successful in attracting a lot of interest from excellent companies based on your resume.
                        You may assist them in making sure that their resumes speak to recruiters by highlighting their successes and the value they can bring to organizations.
                        Similar services can be provided for writing LinkedIn profiles, as many recruiters use this business social network to find potential hires.

                    <p> When you buy insurance, you transfer the cost of a potential loss to the insurance company in exchange for a fee, known as the premium. Insurance companies invest the funds securely,
                         so it can grow, and pay out when there’s a claim.When you buy insurance, you purchase protection against unexpected financial losses. The insurance company pays you or someone you choose if something bad happens to you.
                          If you have no insurance and an accident happens, you may be responsible for all related costs.</p>

                    <p>Mod APKs are made to provide users access to new or improved features that aren't present in the original version of the app. The Android operating system's package file format is called APK, 
                        and it is used to distribute and install mobile applications and middleware in that format.Mod apk files allow individuals to enjoy all the features of a game or an application without spending a penny. 
                        Game lovers often have to purchase several abilities in a game to get through difficult levels.
                         However, the modified APK version will help them achieve those benefits for free.</p>
