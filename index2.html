                <h1>Why you need to get Insured Today?</h1>
                <h3>protect yourself and your loved ones from financial stress caused by some problems in life..</h3>
                <p>Insurance plans are beneficial to anyone looking to protect their family, assets/property and themselves from financial risk/losses:
                     Insurance plans will help you pay for medical emergencies,
                      hospitalisation, contraction of any illnesses and treatment, and medical care required in the future.</p>
                      
      <h3>1. Peace of Mind</h3>
      <p>Insurance, an intangible, provides another intangible: peace of mind.
         Business owners can take on certain business ventures because they can shift the risk — thanks to insurance. 
      </p>
      <h3>2.Family and Business Stability</h3>
      <p>Insurance is a safety net for when risks go wrong. Life insurance can support the life of a family, should a member be lost. 
        It’s similar for a business.
         Should a key member or piece of equipment go out of commission, the business can carry on, thanks to insurance. </p>
      <h3>3.To access service from renders</h3>
      <p>Lenders require that you have insurance. Think about it: 
        Mortgage lenders want proof of insurance before you buy or build a new building. In short, to get the money your business needs to keep going, it’s likely you enjoy the benefits of insurance. Without insurance, your winning business model can't get the funding it needs to take its first step,
         or your established business model can't get the funding to evolve and better compete.</p>
      <h3>4.Complying with legal requirements. </h3>
      <p>Insurance meets statutory and contractual requirements as well as provides evidence of financial resources.
        Workers' compensation is a form of compulsory insurance that's required in most states.
      </p>
      <h3>5.managing cash flow uncertainty.</h3>
      <p> Insurance provides payment for covered losses when they occur. 
         Therefore, the uncertainty of paying for losses out-of-pocket is reduced significantly.</p>
